# Dental Practice Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot specifically designed for dental practices to handle patient inquiries, appointment scheduling, and provide dental care information.

## Installation

To add the chatbot to your dental practice website, add the following code just before the closing `</body>` tag of your website:

```html
<!-- Dental Chatbot Configuration -->
<script>
  window.DENTAL_CHATBOT_CONFIG = {
    businessId: 'YOUR_BUSINESS_ID', // Replace with your business ID
    position: 'bottom-right',       // Options: 'bottom-right', 'bottom-left', 'top-right', 'top-left'
    buttonText: 'Chat with us',     // Customize the chat button text
    primaryColor: '#4F46E5',        // Customize the primary color (hex code)
    backendUrl: 'YOUR_BACKEND_URL'  // Replace with your backend URL
  };
</script>

<!-- Load chatbot styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="YOUR_CHATBOT_HOST/dental-chatbot.css">

<!-- Load chatbot script -->
<script src="YOUR_CHATBOT_HOST/dental-chatbot.js"></script>
